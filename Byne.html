                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Byne was originally a school project I worked on with 2 classmates. I set out to make an abstract narrative game about gender and asked them to work on it together. During this school project, we defined the core world-building and worked on some early prototypes. We struggled finding a balance between narrative and gameplay and ultimately couldn't get the concept off the ground.<br><br>After school, I continued working on the concept without my classmates. I applied for a subsidy through <a href="https://www.stimuleringsfonds.nl/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Stimuleringsfonds </a>to make a demo for the game and was granted the money to work on it for the following 6 months. In this article I will mainly be talking about the demo I've made during that time period, but will also showcase some of the earlier prototypes and research that went into shaping the project.<br><br> The entirety of the demo that you see was made solely by myself (with use of 3rd party assets).<br>After finishing the demo, I made the decision to shelve the project for now, as the full scope of the game is too big to further develop on my own without additional team members and funding for the production.<br></p>

Seeing the entire area from a top-down view on paper, made it very clear what path the water would take, but playing this in third-person perspective made it a lot harder to see and resulted in most players brute forcing their way through the puzzles.<br><br>While on paper it was fun for people to freely experiment and put corks in random geysers, in-game it became tedious for people to keep walking from one geyser to the other, without certainly knowing what the outcome would be.<br></p>

					<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">One technical problem I ran into in the beginning, was finding a good way to restrict the player's movement to a certain area. It was easy to restrict the player to walled in areas by adding a physical barrier, but having them not fall off a ledge proved to be a bit more difficult.<br><br>I started out by using invisible barriers, but this soon turned out to be a grueling inefficient task. I tried Raycasting to the ground below the player to prevent them from falling from certain heights, but I ran into a lot of edge cases that made this method not a reliable option.<br></p>

					<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Eventually I got inspired by the game "The Last Campfire" to use a navigational mesh for the character movement. I had used Unity's Navmesh system multiple times before, but never thought of using it for player character movement.<br><br>Instead of using physics to drive the player character forward, I instead made it pathfind to its target destination using the Navmesh. I then simply used the direction of the movement input to set the target direction right in front of the player, and voilà, all of a sudden, all my problems were solved! (In the GIF, the yellow sphere represents the movement input and the blue sphere represents the final target destination on the Navmesh.)<br><br>This worked wonderfully, giving me full control over the intended play area and leaving no room for edge cases to pop up where the player might fall down from somewhere or get stuck due to some physics-bases issue.&nbsp;<br></p>
